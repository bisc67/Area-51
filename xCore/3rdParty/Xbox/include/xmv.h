/*
 * The following two callbacks are used with XMVCreateDecoderForPackets to
 * supply the decoder with AV packet. 
 *
 * The implementation of these methods should follow this pseudocode:
 *
 * GetNextPacket:
 *
 *   if (Context->NextPacketHasFinishedLoading)
 *   {
 *       Context->PendingPacket  = Context->DecodingPacket;
 *       Context->DecodingPacket = Context->LoadingPacket;
 *       Context->LoadingPacket  = NULL;
 *
 *       *ppPacket = Context->DecodingPacket;
 *       *pOffsetToNextPacket = Context->DecodingPacketSize;
 *   }
 *   else
 *   {
 *       *ppPacket = NULL;
 *       *pOffsetToNextPacket = 0;
 *   }
 * 
 * ReleasePreviousPacket:
 *
 *   if (NextPacketSize)
 *   {
 *       Context->LoadingPacket = Context->PendingPacket;
 *       Context->PendingPacket = NULL;
 *
 *       LoadNextPacketFromOffset(Context->LoadingPacket, NextReadByteOffset, NextPacketSize);
 *   }
 *
 * The loading of the first packet must be done manually as the decoder
 * requires the first 4096 bytes to be loaded so it can create itself.  The
 * decoder will first call the pfnGetNextCallback callback to get the first
 * packet and will then call pfnReleasePreviousPacket when it is safe to start
 * loading the next packet over the previous packet.
 *
 * The memory for the packets must be allocated as contiguous memory via 
 * XPhysicalAlloc if the movie contains ADPCM or 5.1 audio.  
 *
 * During the normal process of decoding, the decoder will alternate calls to
 * pfnGetNextCallback and pfnReleasePreviousPacket, starting with a call to 
 * pfnGetNextCallback to obtain the first packet.  The only exception is if
 * XMVReset is called after pfnReleasePreviousPacket is called at the end
 * of the video with a NextPacketSize of zero.  In this case,
 * pfnReleasePreviousPacket will be called a second time with a nonzero
 * NextPacketSize before pfnGetNextCallback is called again.
 *
 * NextReadByteOffset starts at zero and is incremented by *pOffsetToNextPacket
 * each time pfnGetNextCallback is called.  XMVReset will cause this value to 
 * reset back to zero and looping (when implemented) will cause it to get reset
 * to known values...but the decoder will normally just increment down the file
 * in an orderly fashion.
