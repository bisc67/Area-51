AI Overview

The AI system for B52 involves 5 major base classes.  These classes 
are Actor, Brain, AI_State, Emotion_Controller, and Locomotion_Base_Class.

The Actor:

The Actor object is the base class for actors in the game whether they 
a scientist, a mutant, or the player.  The actual actor class cannot be 
used in the game and this is enforced by pure virtual functions that must 
be implemented.  This class covers the majority of the common 
functionality between all actors.  This functionality includes:

-Updating actor health values
-Inventory
-Collision handling/response base functions
-OnAdvanceLogic time slice
-Performance monitoring for AI, rendering, general logic updating

The Actor base class also holds a fair number of variables including 
a pointer to the brain class and the locomotion class associated with 
the actor.  

The Brain:

The Brain object holds all the AI state objects and Emotion controller.  
It dispenses time to the current AI state, handles the switches between 
states, and updates sensory information.

AI states:

The specific AI states all inherit from a base AI state and 


Emotion Controller:

The Emotion controller keeps track of the emotions for an AI.  The 
emotions are essentially just a set of floats that measure the levels 
of emotions in a several categories.  The currently planned emotions 
are Anger, Fear, Curiosity, Hunger, and Boredom.  These would not have 
a set way that they would affect the AI but would be used by the AI states 
to make decisions.




Putting the pieces together:

The actor contains a brain and a locomotion object.  The actor gives each
system time to update.

The brain contains a list of all known states.
